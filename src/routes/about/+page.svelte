	<h2 class="heading">About Heroiam Slava</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome to Heroiam Slava, a platform dedicated to providing an online obituary for fallen
		Ukrainian soldiers in the Ukraine war. Our mission is to honor and commemorate the brave men and
		women who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of their country and the freedom of the
		world from tyranny.
		<br />
		The conflict in Ukraine has resulted in the loss of countless lives, leaving behind grieving families
		and loved ones. Our website serves as a central database for individuals to pay their respects and
		share stories about those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. Unlike previous wars where
		names were transcribed onto stone, or buried in mass graves at the battle site, this project aims
		to provide a place where for decades people can come and learn about the stories of individual soldiers
		who gave their life to defend not only their homeland but the freedom of the world.
		<br />
		Through our platform, we provide a collaborative space for users to contribute and share information
		about fallen soldiers. This includes information such as their name, rank, branch of service, and
		other personal details. Our website also includes a feature for visitors to leave messages of condolences
		and share memories about the fallen soldiers.
		<br />
		Our website is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all, with a simple search function
		that allows visitors to easily find specific soldiers and their obituaries. Our team is committed
		to ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the information provided on the site, and we continuously
		update and expand our database to include more fallen soldiers.
		<br />
		We believe that it is our duty to honor the sacrifices made by these brave soldiers and to ensure
		that their memory lives on. Our website provides a space for individuals to come together, share
		their grief, and pay their respects to those who have given their lives in defense of Ukraine and
		the world.
		<br />
		Thank you for visiting our website, and we hope that you find it a meaningful and valuable resource
		in remembering and honoring those who have fallen in the Ukraine war. Our project is committed to
		providing comprehensive and accurate reporting on KIA (Killed in Action) incidents in the Ukraine
		conflict. In addition to our simple Reddit and Telegram collection methods for our Ukraine heroes
		system, we have also developed a more advanced system that utilizes the latest technologies in Artificial
		Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).
		<br /> By employing web scraping techniques, we collect data from a wide range of Russian sources,
		including Telegram, subreddits, VK, and local media outlets. Our advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing)
		techniques enable us to accurately identify KIA reports and extract key information, such as the
		name, location, and time of the event. Machine Learning algorithms are then utilized to analyze the
		data and optimize our model to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our reporting. Our state-of-the-art
		technology enables us to gather and analyze data from a variety of sources, providing valuable insights
		into the conflict in Ukraine.s

		<br />
		In addition to our current system for tracking the losses of Ukrainian heroes, we also utilize AI
		and ML to gather and analyze KIA reports from a wide range of Russian sources. This allows us to
		better understand the scope of the conflict and to honor the sacrifices of all who have been lost.
		<br />
		To achieve this, we will utilize web scraping to collect reporting of losses of Russian soldiers
		through local online media platforms such as VK. Automated bots will also be used to gather information
		from relevant channels on Reddit and Telegram. Once the data is collected, AI will be employed to
		pick out relevant items, such as those related to casualties, from the large amount of content gathered
		from these sources.
		<br />
		After relevant information is extracted, ML algorithms will be utilized to further analyze and filter
		the data. These algorithms will be designed to extract only KIA information such as the name, service
		number, age, and location of death of Russian soldiers. By using this approach, we will be able to
		track the casualties of both sides in the conflict and provide a more comprehensive understanding
		of the situation.
